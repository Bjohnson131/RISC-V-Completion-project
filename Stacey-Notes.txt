----- Missing files in project
-- Moved reg5b into riscv library
set_property library riscv [get_files  /media/edata/git/RISC-V-Completion-project/project_2.srcs/sources_1/imports/new/Register/reg5b.vhd]

-- Re-created IP core blk_mem_gen_0

----- Checked timing constraints

-- Commented out unused constraints
-- No timing constraints specified for input clock
-- No clock rate specified. Assumed 100M clk.
-- Added timing constraints and output signal PACKAGE_PINs

# Timing constraints for top level
set_property PACKAGE_PIN C3 [get_ports sysClk]
create_clock -period 20.000 -name sysClk -waveform {0.000 10.000} [get_ports sysClk]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN A1 [get_ports led[0]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN A2 [get_ports led[1]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN A3 [get_ports led[2]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN A4 [get_ports led[3]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN B1 [get_ports led[4]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN B3 [get_ports led[5]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN B4 [get_ports led[6]]
set_property PACKAGE_PIN C1 [get_ports led[7]]


------ Processes

-- Checked all processes to ensure only clock was used in sensitivity list of synchronus ones\

   Not good practice to have additional signals in process sensitivity list in addition to clock.
   Either the process has clock and hence it is a synchronus process
   Or it has no clock and only other signals and is an asynchronus process.
   Not good practise to mix and match

-- Moved 'clear' into clocked if statement

   clear signals located inside of process and clock statement

------ Read through Synthesis warnings

-- Delt with inferred latches
-- Delt with duplicate module warnings


------ Other notes

-- There are some very large muxes (eg: Slider_mux). which may pose problems at higher clock rates
-- Went through all files in repo. Some are empty.

-- Added a testbench (MCU_testbench.vhd) but it seems like there are constructs in controller.vhd that are not compatible with simulation.
-- (got error: ERROR: [XSIM 43-4187] File "/media/edata/git/RISC-V-Completion-project/project_2.srcs/sources_1/imports/new/controller.vhd" Line 98 : The "Vhdl 2008 Matching Selected Signal Assignment Statement" is not supported yet for simulation. )

-- Synthesis and implementation completes.
-- Bitstream generation fails due to an iostandard error. I have been unable to find the correct constraints for this board, and have made a forum post:
https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Timing-Analysis/Vivado-timing-constraint-files-for-KV260-Starter-Kit/td-p/1267130

Once this has been resolved, it should be trivial to update the constraints.
